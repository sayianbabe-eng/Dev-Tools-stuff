            <h2>The Problem </h2>
            <p>The client, Innovate by Day, provided the team with a problem definition specifying their company’s needs. They framed their problem definition as:
              <p><em>How can we reimagine our services to create a scalable, technology-enabled offering that attracts new, 
                high-value clients while staying true to our values of authenticity, creativity, and impact?</em></p>
            </p>
             <p>Upon analysing our chosen primary audience, non-profit organisations, our team restructured their definition to suit the audience’s needs. The new proposed problem definition is: 
             </p>
            <p><em>How might we improve the services of Innovate by Day with AI integration, focusing on creating impactful and engaging storytelling through creative outputs?</em>
             </p> 
            
            <h2>Proposed Soultion</h2>
            <p>After doing Persona research and identifying the trends of AI use in the industry, a detailed solution was crafted.
            </p>
            <p><em>How might we improve the services of Innovate by Day with an AI Adaptive form that analyses client inputs and provides clear design instructions aligned with the brand 
              needs and storytelling to reduce back and forth between client and company? </em>
            </p>
            <p>From this the concept of <strong>Story To Design</strong> was born. <strong>StoryToDesign</strong> Spec is an AI tool that enhances the Innovate By Day service delivery by 
              transforming client inputs to structured project briefs. </p>
